* Self-Discipline, Self-Actualization, and revolting away from Entitlement, Resentment, and the Darkness:
- Self-Discipline, Self-Actualization, Individuation, and overcoming Entitlement, Delusion, and the Isolated Restricted Critical Inner-Self. We have to revolt our way to the truth, and break the chains of lies through discovered action, searching out our wounds, and taking off our various clown costumes and masks.
  - Entitlement is poison. I'm not responsible for your history, you are. I don't owe you anything. Darkness feeds off of your entitlements, because it weakens YOU. It weakens your relationship to life, and is a passegeway to make you bitter, resentful. It makes you want to disempower other people, by choice. It makes you diminsh your own life. Address the darkness inside of you.
- The world oscillates between apathy, anger, resentment, and self pity. Let's see if we can start living in more ideal emotional states. Let's call this an experiment, with ourselves, being the test subject.
  - Do you think your so fragile, than you can't get over being hurt? You will never forget, but don't dwell in nightmares, such that it costs you all the goodness.

"This has not ruined my life, but it has caused me to reshape my life. You cannot go backwards, into the tribe, and expect a tribal wound to undo itself. You cannot do that. Your choice is to go forward in your evolution, and become a more impowered individual consciousness. That's the calling of the journey. Where people fall, is that they continue to go backwards and expect the tribe to undo that wound. You cannot go backwards. You know what happened, you can only go forward and say 'what is this new model of empowered self, that I must become?' And it doesn't mean you forget. It means: I must become this empowered self - I must have a bigger heart, I must have more courage than I thought possible. I don't even want to become this person, but I have no choice. And that's what you need to understand. You do not want to become this person. This is what I mean by facing truth. This is the truth you face. I don't want to become this bigger person, but I have no choice....  In the end forgiveness is a selfish choice, you have to do it to end your own suffering. To finally say, this is about me recognizing you brought out the darkness in me. I'm as dark as you. I didn't know I could hate so much. I didn't know I could hate so much. I didn't know I could resent so deeply. I have to thank you for showing me, I have what it takes to be this small, this bitter, this hateful, because if I could hate you, I could hate alot of people. And that makes me, a horrible person. I have to go take care of this. And this is what it means to put yourself on the cross. To crucify that part of yourself. That's what the death of Jesus was about. Not some off-planet god sacrificing his son."

* Food for the Heart, Ajahn Chah quotes:
#+begin_quote
The more I doubted, the more I meditated, the more I practiced. Wherever doubt arose, I practiced right at that point. Wisdom arose. Things began to change. It’s hard to describe the change that took place. The mind changed until there was no more doubt. I don’t know how it changed. If I were to try telling someone, they probably wouldn’t understand.

One who has zeal never forgoes walking and sitting meditation, never lets up in the maintenance of restraint and composure. A monk who, having finished the meal, hung out his robes, and attended to any incidental business, then starts to do walking meditation—and when we pass by his kuṭı̄ we see his walking path is well worn—this monk is not bored with the practice. He is one who has effort, who has zeal.

Stick to the Buddha’s instruction, “Heedfulness is the way to the deathless: heedlessness is death” (Dhp, 21).

Being heedless is like being dead. Ask yourself, “Will I have time to practice when I die?” Constantly ask, “When will I die?” If we contemplate in this way, our mind will be alert every second. When there is no heedlessness, sati will automatically follow. Wisdom will be clear, seeing all things as they truly are. Mindfulness will guard the mind, knowing the arising of sensations at all times, day and night. That is to have sati. To have sati is to be composed. To be composed is to be heedful. If one is heedful then one is practicing rightly. This is our responsibility.

KĀMOGHA…the flood of sensuality: sunk in sights, in sounds, in smells, in tastes, in bodily sensations. Sunk because we only look at externals, we don’t look inwardly. People don’t see themselves, they only look at others. Everybody else they can see, but not themselves. It’s not such a difficult thing to do. It’s just that people don’t really try.
