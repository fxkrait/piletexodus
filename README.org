* Food for the Heart, Ajahn Chah quotes:
#+begin_quote
The more I doubted, the more I meditated, the more I practiced. Wherever doubt arose, I practiced right at that point. Wisdom arose. Things began to change. It’s hard to describe the change that took place. The mind changed until there was no more doubt. I don’t know how it changed. If I were to try telling someone, they probably wouldn’t understand.

Those who don’t keep the vinaya or practice meditation and those who do practice can’t live together; they must go separate ways. I didn’t understand this myself in the past. As a teacher I taught others, but I didn’t practice. This is really bad. When I looked deeply into it, my practice and my knowledge were as far apart as earth and sky.

Those who have only practiced a little and then go to teach others are not yet ripe. They don’t really understand. In a short time they give up and it all falls apart.

Kāmasukhallikānuyoga —indulgence in sense pleasures and comfort—is a danger. We should strengthen our practice, exhort ourselves to do more, rectify whatever is faulty, and not get lost in externals.

One who has zeal never forgoes walking and sitting meditation, never lets up in the maintenance of restraint and composure. A monk who, having finished the meal, hung out his robes, and attended to any incidental business, then starts to do walking meditation—and when we pass by his kuṭı̄ we see his walking path is well worn—this monk is not bored with the practice. He is one who has effort, who has zeal.

I resolved, “Okay, I’ll give up this body and mind for this lifetime and try to follow the teaching of the Buddha down to the last detail. I’ll reach understanding in this very lifetime, because if I don’t I’ll still be sunk in suffering. I’ll let go of everything else and make a determined effort; no matter how much difficulty or suffering I have to endure, I’ll persevere. If I don’t do this, I’ll just keep on doubting.”

If there is no effort in the practice the mind will tend in that direction. You don’t oppose and resist your own mind; you just allow it to waft along on the wind of your moods. This is called following one’s moods. Like a child, if we indulge all its wants will it be a good child? If the parents indulge all their child’s wishes is that good? Even if they do indulge it somewhat at first, by the time it can speak they may start to occasionally spank it because they’re afraid it’ll end up stupid. The training of our mind must be like this. You have to know yourself and how to train yourself. If you don’t know how to train your own mind, waiting around expecting someone else to train it for you, you’ll end up in trouble. Practice has no limits. Whether standing, walking, sitting, or lying down, you can always practice. You can realize the Dhamma while sweeping the monastery grounds or seeing a beam of sunlight. But you must have sati at hand. If you meditate ardently, you can realize the Dhamma at any time, in any place.

Don’t be heedless. Be watchful; be alert. While walking on alms round there are all sorts of feelings arising, and it’s all good Dhamma. When you get back to the monastery and are eating your food there’s plenty of good Dhamma for you to look into. If you have constant effort, all these things will be objects for contemplation; wisdom will arise, and you will see the Dhamma. This is called Dhamma-vicaya, reflecting on Dhamma. It’s one of the Factors of Enlightenment. If we have mindfulness, we won’t simply take it easy, and there will also be inquiry into Dhamma.

Actually, in terms of ultimate truth, it’s not necessary to go through the routine of confessing offenses. If we see that our mind is pure and there is no trace of doubt, then those offenses drop off right there. That we are not yet pure is because we still doubt; we still waver. We are not really pure, so we can’t let go. We don’t see ourselves—this is the point. This vinaya of ours is like a fence to guard us from making mistakes, so it’s something we need to be scrupulous with.

From the day he took that money, it was as if a gap had opened between us. We could no longer understand each other. He’s still my witness to this very day. Ever since that day I haven’t used money or engaged in any buying or selling. I’ve been restrained in every way with money. I was constantly wary of wrongdoing, even though I hadn’t done anything wrong. Inwardly I maintained the meditation practice. I no longer needed wealth. I saw it as a poison. Whether you give poison to a human being, a dog, or any other being, it invariably causes death or suffering. If we see this clearly we will be constantly on our guard not to take that “poison.

If other monks wanted to give me requisites, such as a bowl, razor, or whatever, I wouldn’t accept them unless I knew that the donors were fellow practitioners with a similar standard of vinaya. Why not? How can you trust someone who is unrestrained? They can do all sorts of things. Unrestrained monks don’t see the value of the vinaya, so it’s possible that they could have obtained those things in improper ways. I was that scrupulous.

As a result, some of my fellow monks would look askance at me. “He doesn’t socialize, he won’t mix.” But I was unmoved. “Well, we can mix with one another when we die,” I thought, “for then we’re all in the same boat.” I lived with forbearance. I was one who spoke little. If others criticized my practice, I was unmoved. Why? Because even if I explained to them they wouldn’t understand. They knew nothing about practice. Like those times when I would be invited to a funeral ceremony and somebody would say, “Don’t listen to him! Just put the money in his bag and don’t say anything about it. Don’t let him know.”30 I would say, “Hey, do you think I’m dead or something? Just because one calls alcohol perfume doesn’t make it perfume, you know. But you people, when you want to drink alcohol you call it perfume, so go ahead and drink. You must be crazy!”
