 "Christianity agrees with Dualism that this universe is at war. But it does not think this is a war between independent powers. It thinks it is a civil war, a rebellion, and that we are living in a part of the universe occupied by the rebel...Enemy-occupied territory—that is what this world is. Christianity is the story of how the rightful king has landed, you might say landed in disguise, and is calling us all to take part in a great campaign of sabotage. When you go to church you are really listening-in to the secret wireless from our friends: that is why the enemy is so anxious to prevent us from going. He does it by playing on our conceit and laziness and intellectual snobbery."
 - Mere Christianity, C.S. Lewis

- Pilétexod.us takes this concept, but transmutes it into a *worldwide empirical heedful slave revolt*.
  - Daddy buddha has arrived, and there's nothing you can do to stop it, and he's going to expose all that are heedless. You're going to be forced to become heedful. We can call this something like *social eugenics*.
    - Imagine bombs going off in Kosovo, and you can see there are still 50K Kosovans getting their pushups in, and keeping their routines and standards despite the war.

   1. Work Intervals (Pomodoro)
   2. Exercise (Cardio, however strength training is associated with longetivity)

      1. Improves immune system, psychological resillience, increases serotonin, aids in recovery.
   5. Low EMF Infrared Sauna (30 min)
      1. Detox + Heart Health (4 days a week, 50% less chance of cardiovascular issues)
   6. Meditation (Vipassana, sitting [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiza][seiza]] bench)
   7. Some deliberately creative, artistic, challenging, and stimulating activity (music/art/coding, etc)
2. Time Blocking ([[https://github.com/ichernyshovvv/org-timeblock][org-timeblock]])

7. Only exceptions to the above, are if you're on [[https://kunja.dhamma.org/][retreat]], but hold to it as much as you can.
