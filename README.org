*(My) Formula for an exciting, non-slaveic, heedful life:*

#+begin_quote
1. Habit Tracking (Daily, and *Pseudoanonymously Publicized*)
   1. Work Intervals (Pomodoro)
   2. Exercise (Cardio, however strength training is associated with longetivity)
   3. Stretching (Yoga)
   4. Cold Water (Showers, or better yet via electric plunge tub)
      1. Improves immune system, psychological resillience, increases serotonin, aids in recovery.
   5. Low EMF Infrared Sauna (30 min)
      1. Detox + Heart Health (4 days a week, 50% less chance of cardiovascular issues)
   6. Meditation (Vipassana, sitting [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiza][seiza]] bench)
   7. Some deliberately creative, artistic, challenging, and stimulating activity (music/art/coding, etc)
2. Time Blocking ([[https://github.com/ichernyshovvv/org-timeblock][org-timeblock]])
3. Task Tracking ([[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]])
4. Journal
   1. Gratitude
   2. Reflection
5. Goal/Vision Setting
6. A note-taking, organizational system ([[https://github.com/vicrdguez/dendroam][dendroam]])
   1. Ingest content that interests you, stimulates you, challenges you, and expands your frame of reference. Take some notes, think about the ideas, and expand/incorporate/connect the ideas with other adjacent ideas and concepts.
7. Only exceptions to the above, are if you're on [[https://kunja.dhamma.org/][retreat]], but hold to it as much as you can.
