- Self-Discipline, Self-Actualization, Individuation, and overcoming Entitlement, Delusion, and the Isolated Restricted Critical Inner-Self. We have to revolt our way to the truth, and break the chains of lies through discovered action, search out our wounds, and take off the clown costume and masks.

* Food for the Heart, Ajahn Chah quotes:

The more I doubted, the more I meditated, the more I practiced. Wherever doubt arose, I practiced right at that point. Wisdom arose. Things began to change. It’s hard to describe the change that took place. The mind changed until there was no more doubt. I don’t know how it changed. If I were to try telling someone, they probably wouldn’t understand.

One who has zeal never forgoes walking and sitting meditation, never lets up in the maintenance of restraint and composure. A monk who, having finished the meal, hung out his robes, and attended to any incidental business, then starts to do walking meditation—and when we pass by his kuṭı̄ we see his walking path is well worn—this monk is not bored with the practice. He is one who has effort, who has zeal.

Stick to the Buddha’s instruction, “Heedfulness is the way to the deathless: heedlessness is death” (Dhp, 21).

Being heedless is like being dead. Ask yourself, “Will I have time to practice when I die?” Constantly ask, “When will I die?” If we contemplate in this way, our mind will be alert every second. When there is no heedlessness, sati will automatically follow. Wisdom will be clear, seeing all things as they truly are. Mindfulness will guard the mind, knowing the arising of sensations at all times, day and night. That is to have sati. To have sati is to be composed. To be composed is to be heedful. If one is heedful then one is practicing rightly. This is our responsibility.

KĀMOGHA…the flood of sensuality: sunk in sights, in sounds, in smells, in tastes, in bodily sensations. Sunk because we only look at externals, we don’t look inwardly. People don’t see themselves, they only look at others. Everybody else they can see, but not themselves. It’s not such a difficult thing to do. It’s just that people don’t really try.
