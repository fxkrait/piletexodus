ðŸ’¡ It's very liberating when you realize that you can simply decide to ignore the goings-on in society-at-large, do completely your own thing, be your own unique and whole person per your own definition, and focus on the positivity and happenings directly in your own particular life. You can keep other's voices out in the distance, otherwise they will talk your ear off, without any shame or restraint, and dominate and impose themselves on to you, and laud it over you because "you allowed them". So just ignore them, work off first principles, stay curious and engaged, beginner's mind, live a heedful life, give it your all, keep moving, and at the very least try to avoid tearing others down, and don't take any of this too too seriously, but remain heedful. ðŸ§

"There is no advantage to being exceptional."

"We should not behave differently than the community of monks."

"A person who has the will to seek the truth, and who has the intention to throw away fame and profit, can enter the way. A person who does not sincerely seek the truth, should not be allowed to enter. If there are some who are not sincere, and have been admitted by mistake, we should, after consideration, make them leave. We should notice that if we have the will to follow the truth, we will become free from fame and profit."
- Dogen

"I am the most deluded person in the world, that is why I zazen."

"Make every effort not to rise in the world."

"Zazen brings no benefit. It takes you out of the world of loss and gain. It should be practiced."
- Kodo Sawaki

 "Christianity agrees with Dualism that this universe is at war. But it does not think this is a war between independent powers. It thinks it is a civil war, a rebellion, and that we are living in a part of the universe occupied by the rebel...Enemy-occupied territoryâ€”that is what this world is. Christianity is the story of how the rightful king has landed, you might say landed in disguise, and is calling us all to take part in a great campaign of sabotage. When you go to church you are really listening-in to the secret wireless from our friends: that is why the enemy is so anxious to prevent us from going. He does it by playing on our conceit and laziness and intellectual snobbery."
 - Mere Christianity, C.S. Lewis

- PilÃ©texod.us takes this concept, but transmutes it into a *heedful xenia*.
  - Imagine bombs are going off in Kosovo, and you can see on ~piletexod.us~ that there are still 50K Kosovans getting their exercise in, and keeping their routines and standards despite the war, and letting you, and the world know it. How powerful would that be? A world full of heedful individuals? Constant, unrelenting relinquishment of all that is heedless. Making the heedful more public, and putting the spotlight upon it.
    - All societies and governments are social. All religions, even buddhism, that one where you meditate by yourself all day, have a sangha. It's not purely about one's isolated wisdom. It's not solipsistic. There is an aspect of connectivity, togetherness. There is a sense, that there is a group project going on here.

osho-san: "What remains with you boys, if we take away your appetite for sex and food?"

disciples: "osho-san, what is the benefit of practicing zazen?"

osho-san: "Even if you practice zazen, it comes to nothing."

disciples: "osho-san, we have come to practice a zazen that will bring us no benefit."
