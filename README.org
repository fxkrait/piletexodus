* Food for the Heart, Ajahn Chah quotes:
#+begin_quote
The more I doubted, the more I meditated, the more I practiced. Wherever doubt arose, I practiced right at that point. Wisdom arose. Things began to change. It’s hard to describe the change that took place. The mind changed until there was no more doubt. I don’t know how it changed. If I were to try telling someone, they probably wouldn’t understand.

One who has zeal never forgoes walking and sitting meditation, never lets up in the maintenance of restraint and composure. A monk who, having finished the meal, hung out his robes, and attended to any incidental business, then starts to do walking meditation—and when we pass by his kuṭı̄ we see his walking path is well worn—this monk is not bored with the practice. He is one who has effort, who has zeal.

Stick to the Buddha’s instruction, “Heedfulness is the way to the deathless: heedlessness is death” (Dhp, 21).

Being heedless is like being dead. Ask yourself, “Will I have time to practice when I die?” Constantly ask, “When will I die?” If we contemplate in this way, our mind will be alert every second. When there is no heedlessness, sati will automatically follow. Wisdom will be clear, seeing all things as they truly are. Mindfulness will guard the mind, knowing the arising of sensations at all times, day and night. That is to have sati. To have sati is to be composed. To be composed is to be heedful. If one is heedful then one is practicing rightly. This is our responsibility.

How pitiful that people are so out of touch with themselves! They’re always looking outward, at trees, at other people, at external objects, saying, “This one is big,” “that’s small,” “that’s short,” “that’s long.” They’re so busy looking at other things they never see themselves. Honestly, people are really pitiful. They have no refuge.

I resolved, “Okay, I’ll give up this body and mind for this lifetime and try to follow the teaching of the Buddha down to the last detail. I’ll reach understanding in this very lifetime, because if I don’t I’ll still be sunk in suffering. I’ll let go of everything else and make a determined effort; no matter how much difficulty or suffering I have to endure, I’ll persevere. If I don’t do this, I’ll just keep on doubting.”

If there is no effort in the practice the mind will tend in that direction. You don’t oppose and resist your own mind; you just allow it to waft along on the wind of your moods. This is called following one’s moods. Like a child, if we indulge all its wants will it be a good child? If the parents indulge all their child’s wishes is that good? Even if they do indulge it somewhat at first, by the time it can speak they may start to occasionally spank it because they’re afraid it’ll end up stupid. The training of our mind must be like this. You have to know yourself and how to train yourself. If you don’t know how to train your own mind, waiting around expecting someone else to train it for you, you’ll end up in trouble. Practice has no limits. Whether standing, walking, sitting, or lying down, you can always practice. You can realize the Dhamma while sweeping the monastery grounds or seeing a beam of sunlight. But you must have sati at hand. If you meditate ardently, you can realize the Dhamma at any time, in any place.

Don’t be heedless. Be watchful; be alert. While walking on alms round there are all sorts of feelings arising, and it’s all good Dhamma. When you get back to the monastery and are eating your food there’s plenty of good Dhamma for you to look into. If you have constant effort, all these things will be objects for contemplation; wisdom will arise, and you will see the Dhamma. This is called Dhamma-vicaya, reflecting on Dhamma. It’s one of the Factors of Enlightenment. If we have mindfulness, we won’t simply take it easy, and there will also be inquiry into Dhamma.

Actually, in terms of ultimate truth, it’s not necessary to go through the routine of confessing offenses. If we see that our mind is pure and there is no trace of doubt, then those offenses drop off right there. That we are not yet pure is because we still doubt; we still waver. We are not really pure, so we can’t let go. We don’t see ourselves—this is the point. This vinaya of ours is like a fence to guard us from making mistakes, so it’s something we need to be scrupulous with.

From the day he took that money, it was as if a gap had opened between us. We could no longer understand each other. He’s still my witness to this very day. Ever since that day I haven’t used money or engaged in any buying or selling. I’ve been restrained in every way with money. I was constantly wary of wrongdoing, even though I hadn’t done anything wrong. Inwardly I maintained the meditation practice. I no longer needed wealth. I saw it as a poison. Whether you give poison to a human being, a dog, or any other being, it invariably causes death or suffering. If we see this clearly we will be constantly on our guard not to take that “poison.

If other monks wanted to give me requisites, such as a bowl, razor, or whatever, I wouldn’t accept them unless I knew that the donors were fellow practitioners with a similar standard of vinaya. Why not? How can you trust someone who is unrestrained? They can do all sorts of things. Unrestrained monks don’t see the value of the vinaya, so it’s possible that they could have obtained those things in improper ways. I was that scrupulous.

As a result, some of my fellow monks would look askance at me. “He doesn’t socialize, he won’t mix.” But I was unmoved. “Well, we can mix with one another when we die,” I thought, “for then we’re all in the same boat.” I lived with forbearance. I was one who spoke little. If others criticized my practice, I was unmoved. Why? Because even if I explained to them they wouldn’t understand. They knew nothing about practice. Like those times when I would be invited to a funeral ceremony and somebody would say, “Don’t listen to him! Just put the money in his bag and don’t say anything about it. Don’t let him know.”30 I would say, “Hey, do you think I’m dead or something? Just because one calls alcohol perfume doesn’t make it perfume, you know. But you people, when you want to drink alcohol you call it perfume, so go ahead and drink. You must be crazy!”

Those who don’t keep the vinaya or practice meditation and those who do practice can’t live together; they must go separate ways. I didn’t understand this myself in the past. As a teacher I taught others, but I didn’t practice. This is really bad. When I looked deeply into it, my practice and my knowledge were as far apart as earth and sky.

Those who have only practiced a little and then go to teach others are not yet ripe. They don’t really understand. In a short time they give up and it all falls apart.

Kāmasukhallikānuyoga —indulgence in sense pleasures and comfort—is a danger. We should strengthen our practice, exhort ourselves to do more, rectify whatever is faulty, and not get lost in externals.

If all of you devote yourselves like this to the practice, then not many problems will arise. If you don’t abide with the practice, the walking and sitting meditation, there’s nothing more than just traveling around. Not liking it here you go traveling over there; not liking it there you come touring back here. That’s all there is to it, following your noses everywhere. You don’t have to do a lot of traveling around; just stay here and develop the practice, learn it in detail. Make an effort, all of you.

Living in this way we rely on endurance, persevering in the face of all the defilements. Although this is good, it is still on the level of “practicing the Dhamma without having seen it.” If we have practiced the Dhamma and seen it, then whatever is wrong we will have already given up; whatever is useful we will have cultivated. Seeing this within ourselves, we experience a sense of well-being. No matter what others say, we know our own mind; we are not moved. We can be at peace anywhere. Now the younger monks and novices who have just begun to practice may think that the senior Ajahn doesn’t seem to do much walking or sitting meditation. Don’t imitate him in this. You should emulate, but not imitate. To emulate is one thing; to imitate another. The fact is that the senior Ajahn dwells within his own particular contented abiding. Even though he doesn’t seem to practice externally, he practices inwardly. Whatever is in his mind cannot be seen by the eye. The practice of Buddhism is the practice of the mind. Even though the practice may not be apparent in his actions or speech, the mind is a different matter.

They beautify house and home, but they don’t think of beautifying their own hearts. They don’t examine suffering. The Buddha taught us to find a refuge within our own hearts: Attāhi attano nātho—make yourself a refuge unto yourself. Who else can be your refuge? The true refuge is the heart, nothing else. You may try to depend on other things, but they aren’t dependable. You can only really depend on other things if you already have a refuge within yourself.

So all of you, both lay people and monastics, who have come to visit today, please consider this teaching. Ask yourselves, “Who am I? Why am I here? Why was I born?” Some people don’t know. They want to be happy, but the suffering never stops. Rich or poor, young or old, they suffer just the same. It’s all suffering. And why? Because they have no wisdom. The poor are unhappy because they don’t have enough, and the rich are unhappy because they have too much.

Love and hate are both suffering, because of desire. Wanting is suffering; wanting not to have is suffering. Wanting to acquire things—even if you get them it’s still suffering, because you’re afraid you’ll lose them. There’s only suffering. How are you going to live with that? You may have a large, luxurious house, but if your heart isn’t good it never really works out as you expected.

If suffering arises people don’t know what to do. Where to go to treat it? They want to avoid suffering, be free of it, but they don’t know how to treat it when it arises. And they live on like this until they get old and sick…and die.

In olden times it was said that if someone was mortally ill, one of the next of kin should whisper Bud-dho Bud-dho in their ear. What are they going to do with Buddho? What good is Buddho going to be for them when they’re almost on the funeral pyre? Why didn’t they learn Buddho when they were young and healthy? Now with the breaths coming fitfully, you go up and say, “Mother! Bud-dho, Bud-dho!” Why waste your time? You’ll only confuse her. Let her go peacefully.

When people are newly married they get on together all right, but after age fifty or so they can’t understand each other. Whatever the wife says the husband finds intolerable. Whatever the husband says the wife won’t listen. They turn their backs on each other.

Now I’m just talking because I’ve never had a family. Why haven’t I had a family? Just looking at this word household, 36 I knew what it was all about. What is a “household”? This is a “hold”: If somebody were to get some rope and tie us up while we were sitting here, what would that be like? That’s called “being held.” There is a circle of confinement. The man lives within his circle of confinement, and the woman lives within her circle of confinement.

This word household is a heavy one. No trifling matter, it’s a real killer. The word hold is a symbol of suffering. You can’t go anywhere; you’ve got to stay within your circle of confinement.
Now we come to the word house. This means “that which hassles.” Have you ever toasted chilies? The whole house chokes and sneezes. This word household spells confusion; it’s not worth the trouble. Because of this word I was able to be ordained and not disrobe. The household is frightening. You’re stuck and can’t go anywhere. Problems with the children, with money, and all the rest. Arguments in profusion until your dying day. But where can you go? You’re tied down, with nowhere to go, no matter how much suffering it is. The tears pour out and they keep on pouring. If there’s no household, you might be able to finish with the tears, but not otherwise.
